        <p> <h3><strong>Biography:</strong></h3> Joseph Neveu is a Houston native born and raised. 
            Growing up in the Houston, he cultivated a deep appreciation for the diverse culinary scene the city has to offer.
            Helping to raise his younger siblings, he got the opportunity to practice his craft as he would make meals for the family.
            Trying meals from different cultures always fascinated him and were always a hit with the family.<br>
            <br>
            During his pursuit to further his knowledge and expertise in the culinary world,
            he realized there was a need that he could fill within his community. That need was to provide the 
            home cooked meal that so many students miss out on college campuses.<br> 
            <br>
            That brings us to today. He wanted to give back to the city that raised him and 
            led him down the path that he is on today. To do so, he is striving to bring
            a variety of dishes from the many cultures that make up the Houston melting pot, to
            the new University of Houston cafeteria at Sugar Land. This way no matter how far it may be,
            everyone can enjoy a little taste of home.
